# automated-data-science-pipeline
This project builds an automated data science pipeline that takes a dataset and performs data ingestion and cleaning with minimal manual effort. It aims to improve data quality, reduce preprocessing time, and provide a scalable base that can later be extended to EDA and modeling stages.
